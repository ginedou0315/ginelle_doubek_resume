    introduction:
      "At the beginning of my career, I was leaning towards of becoming a researcher. I finished my Bachelors in Agricultural Economics and majored in Price and Marketing analysis. My first job was in Data management for local projects that my previous university was conducting. I was collecting and storing information from each projects assigned to me. I only stayed on the job for one year and started to look for something more challenging. I moved to the city and found a job as a Sales Assistant. Just a month being in the position, my immediate manager saw the potential in me and promoted me to Sales Manager. This started my journey in Sales and Marketing from working with different multinational companies like Unilever, Procter & Gamble and Nestle. After a few years working in Sales, I took break to study Master in Business Management. During this time, I also worked as Research assistant part-time for a non-profit organization (International Rice Research Institute).",

      "Zu Beginn meiner Laufbahn tendierte ich dazu, Forscher zu werden. Ich habe meinen Bachelor in Agrarwirtschaft mit dem Schwerpunkt Preis- und Marketinganalyse gemacht. Mein erster Job war das Datenmanagement fÃ¼r lokale Projekte, die meine frÃ¼here UniversitÃ¤t durchfÃ¼hrte. Ich sammelte und speicherte Informationen aus allen mir zugewiesenen Projekten. Ich blieb nur ein Jahr in diesem Job und suchte nach einer grÃ¶ÃŸeren Herausforderung. Ich zog in die Stadt und fand eine Stelle als Vertriebsassistentin. Nach nur einem Monat in dieser Position erkannte mein direkter Vorgesetzter das Potenzial in mir und befÃ¶rderte mich zum Vertriebsleiter. Damit begann meine Reise in den Bereich Vertrieb und Marketing, wo ich fÃ¼r verschiedene multinationale Unternehmen wie Unilever, Procter & Gamble und Nestle arbeitete. Nach einigen Jahren im Vertrieb machte ich eine Pause, um meinen Master in Business Management zu machen. WÃ¤hrend dieser Zeit arbeitete ich auch als Forschungsassistentin in Teilzeit fÃ¼r eine gemeinnÃ¼tzige Organisation (International Rice Research Institute).",
